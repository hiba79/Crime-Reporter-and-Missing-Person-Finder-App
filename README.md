# Crime-Reporter-and-Missing-Person-Finder-App
This App allows user to file complaints or missing reports and keep a track of it. There are 3 categories that a user can file; 
Complaint, 
Crime Report and 
Missing Report and can see all the status of what action has been taken by the admin. 

To file any of the above 3 the user should register himself to the system and provide his right credentials to file them. The App also allows anonymous users who doesn’t want to register to check the crimes at his or any other area, the system displays the crimes if any filed. The unregistered user can also take advantage of
checking the missing persons or crime report but he is refrained from viewing complaints filed by the other users. The unregistered user cannot enter data in the app only view data. Each report will be filed for a particular city. For now you can have
